# iPadTest

This is a **test repo** to determine whether or not I can work with github repos on my iPad air 2. 

I also have an iPad air 1. If it works on both (I don't think it will), then I should be able to only keep the iPad air 1, and sell the iPad air 2. I like both of the devices, but neither of them do exactly what I need them to do. I bought the iPad air 2 from my sister as it could do some of the things I needed which I couldn't do with the iPad air 1, however it still doesn't have all the fuctions I would like. Therefore, I will probably save for a more recent tablet with extended functionality.

Ideally the device would be able to:
	
	-Edit and write files hosted on github
	-Track stylus input smoothly and accurately
	-Function as a display for a linux-based mini computer (such as RPi 4 running Ubuntu)
